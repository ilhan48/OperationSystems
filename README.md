*RESULT for Fork in C Directory *

STEP1:

STEP2:
Description: I added a "wait()" function to the if block written for parent. As a result, the resulting parent process waited for the child processes to run and finish. When the child processes finished working, the parent process also worked and terminated. That's why in the console output, the child pid is written first and then the parent pid.
